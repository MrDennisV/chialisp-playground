;; ===============================================================
;; FIRST SIMPLE LIBRARY - Basic Mathematical Functions
;; FILE: simple_math.clib (LIBRARY - NOT EXECUTABLE)
;; 
;; This is your first .clib library
;; Contains only function definitions, no (mod ...)
;; Designed to be included in other programs
;; ===============================================================

(
;; === SIMPLE MATHEMATICAL FUNCTIONS ===

;; Function 1: Square of a number
(defun-inline square (n) 
  (* n n))
  
;; Function 2: Check if even
(defun-inline is_even (n) 
  (= (logand n 1) 0))
  
;; Function 3: Absolute value
(defun-inline absolute (n) 
  (if (> 0 n) (- 0 n) n))

;; Function 4: Maximum of two numbers
(defun-inline max2 (a b)
  (if (> a b) a b))

;; === IMPORTANT NOTES ===
;; 
;; 1. This file has NO (mod ...) - it's just a library
;; 2. Uses defun-inline for simple functions (better performance)
;; 3. Functions are documented with strings
;; 4. Include with: (include "includes/simple_math.clib")
;; 5. Remember to use flag: run -i ./examples/ your_program.clsp
